## Introduction

We don't have many secrets on stored on the Modernisation Platform, but they are rotated regularly, every 180 days.

This guide advises where secrets are stored and how to rotate them.

There are multiple connections to PagerDuty (pagerduty_token and pagerduty_userapi_token) due to the way PagerDuty connects to slack. It requires an api token to get the organisations to allow the connection to slack.
If this changes in the future it may no longer be needed.
